         United have also won three European Cups/UEFA Champions Leagues, one UEFA Europa League, one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, one UEFA Super Cup, one Intercontinental Cup and one FIFA Club World Cup. In 1998–99,
          the club became the first in the history of English football to achieve the continental European treble.
         [7] By winning the UEFA Europa League in 2016–17, they became one of five clubs to have won all three main UEFA club competitions. The 1958 Munich air disaster claimed the lives of eight players. In 1968, 
         under the management of Matt Busby, 
         Manchester United became the first English football club to win the European Cup. Alex Ferguson won 38 trophies as manager,
          including 13 Premier League titles, 5 FA Cups and 2 UEFA Champions Leagues, between 1986 and 2013,[8][9][10] when he announced his retirement.
